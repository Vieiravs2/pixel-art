# pixel-art
Project of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at the end of Unit 5 (Principles of Web Development Module) of Trybe's Web Development course.

We had to develop a dynamic and interactive web page where the user could paint the pixels on a board using a palette of colors generated randomly. The user can also change the size of the board.

I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.
